prompt: `describe more about the three main machine learning models`

    Supervised Learning:

        Definition: This model uses labeled data, meaning the input data is paired with the correct output.
        Example: Think of it like a student learning from a teacher. The teacher provides the correct answers (labels) for the student to learn from.
        Application: Used for tasks like image classification, where the model learns to identify objects in images based on labeled examples.

    Unsupervised Learning:

        Definition: This model works with unlabeled data and tries to find hidden patterns or structures in the data.
        Example: Imagine exploring a new city without a map. You observe and group similar landmarks together based on your observations.
        Application: Commonly used for clustering tasks, such as customer segmentation in marketing.

    Reinforcement Learning:

        Definition: This model trains agents by rewarding them for positive actions and penalizing them for negative ones.
        Example: Think of it like training a pet. You reward your pet with treats for good behavior and withhold treats for bad behavior.
        Application: Often used in scenarios like game playing or robotics, where agents learn to make decisions through trial and error.

    Supervised Learning:

        Spam Detection: Email services use supervised learning to classify emails as spam or not spam based on labeled examples.
        Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing customer reviews to determine whether they are positive, negative, or neutral.
        Medical Diagnosis: Predicting diseases based on patient data and historical medical records.

    Unsupervised Learning:

        Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual patterns in data, such as fraud detection in financial transactions.
        Market Basket Analysis: Discovering associations between products purchased together in retail.
        Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers into segments based on purchasing behavior for targeted marketing.

    Reinforcement Learning:

        Autonomous Vehicles: Training self-driving cars to navigate and make decisions in real-time.
        Robotics: Teaching robots to perform tasks like picking and placing objects in a warehouse.
        Game Playing: Developing AI agents that can play and win games like chess or Go.
